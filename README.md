# 🏙️ Airbnb NYC 2023 Data Analysis

This project involves deep data cleaning and analysis of the [Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Using `pandas` and `numpy`, we've explored patterns in listings, pricing, availability, and neighborhood trends to derive actionable insights.
